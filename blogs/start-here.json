I am a software engineer who loves cooking, bbq, staying active, exploring, and building. I made this conglomeration of applications to demonstrate bringing free/open-source technology together to make data accessible to a broad audience. I also want to show utilizing multiple techniques to make it appear seamless but have different themes and some links to tie everything together. As time progresses, you may notice the application/site receiving enhancements or updates to improve UI/UX, data handling, or new features. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find some value in the content here. :)",
